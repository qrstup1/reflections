What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  git init creates a file called .git within the directory. This allows for the
  meta data for each version to be saved, which will allow for recall later
  if I need it. Without this init process, the data relating to the commits would
  not have a place to live.
  git status showed the current status of git, branch, working directory, number
  of commits and a listing of files being tracked.

  git add ____ allows for adding a file to the staging area.
  git commit____ will then commit the file.
